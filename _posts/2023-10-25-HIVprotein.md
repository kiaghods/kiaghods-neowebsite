HIV infection is a significant public health issue, and while the role of nutrition, particularly albumin and globulin, in HIV progression is recognized, no mathematical models have previously described their interaction with the virus. In this paper, we present a model that accurately describes this interaction, revealing that albumin and globulin do not impact the infection rate or immune response, and identify that better data could improve our understanding of these dynamics. I presented this work at various venues, most notably at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCQo-TN3kDI'> The Global Health Leaders Conference at Johns Hopkins University (2022)</a>.
